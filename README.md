## CodeBase

The codebase consists three major components: main.dart, app.dart, and the screen folder.

The 'main' is where I execute the application, 'app.dart' is where I manage the MaterialApp for Theming and such.

the screen folders are where the screen widgets reside display.

There were very little need for state management techniques.

When the user taps on a textbutton labelled 'check me out', the app navigates to Aboutpage screen.

The Aboutpage also has a back button to navigate back to the homepage.
